# Coach Academy -PST "LEVEL 2"

Coach Academy is named after the nickname of Coach Mohamed Abd El-Wahab “The Coach”, as he is the most famous Coach in the Arab region and one of the few Coaches worldwide who have qualified the largest number of students to the ICPC.

Coach Mohamed Abd El-Wahab is one of the main partners and founders of Coach Academy and is heading the training team in the Academy.

Graduated from Computer Science Department from Faculty of computers and information – Cairo University 2001 and Finished MSc Computer Science Department from Faculty of computers and information – Cairo University 2010. TA at Faculty of computers and information – Cairo University, The American university in Cairo and Regional Informatics Center at Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport.

IBM and ICPC honored him with a ‘Coach Award’ in May 2012 at the ICPC World Finals. As this award is given to coaches that have brought teams to the World Finals for five years or more.

## Level 2 - DATA STRUCTURES, ALGORITHMS & OOP

This course introduces students to the design and implementation of fundamental data structures and algorithms. It covers basic data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, binary heaps, hash tables, binary search trees, and graphs), searching and sorting algorithms, basic analysis of algorithms, and very basic object-oriented programming concepts. The programming language used for this course is C++. 

C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language.

## Syllabus

Part 1: The 4 major principles that make an language Object Oriented. These are Encapsulation, Data Abstraction, Polymorphism and Inheritance. 

Part 2: Algorithms using the simplest Linear Data Structure: Array, e.g. Sorting and a few others.

Part 3: Various Linear Data Structures (DSes): 

      a)	List Abstract Data Structure (ADT) 
      
      b)	Stack, Queue, and Deque ADTs in their Linked List implementations.
      
Part 4: Various (Non-)Linear Data Structures (DSes): 

      a)	Priority Queue ADT and its Binary Heap implementation.
      
      b)	Table/Map (ADT) part 1 (unordered) and its Hash Table implementation.
      
      c)	Table/Map (ADT) part 2 (ordered) and its Binary Search Tree (BST) implementation, inclusive of the balanced BST version: Adelson-Velskii Landis (AVL) Tree.
      
      d)	Graph DS: Adjacency Matrix/Adjacency List/Edge List/Implicit Graph.
      
Part 5: Algorithms for Graph Traversal: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and various application scenarios.


I was fortunate enough to get this opportunity. I have finished level 1, and this is Level 2 into my journey. Inside this folder I will be posting all the practice and contests coming up in my level 2 training. 

The problem sets are from various different websites, link for each problem will be mentioned above the code for reference.  

This is my journey into computer science :).
